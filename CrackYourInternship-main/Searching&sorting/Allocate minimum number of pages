/** You have N books, each with Ai number of pages. M students need to be allocated contiguous books, with each student getting at least one book. Out of all the permutations, the goal is to find the permutation where the student with the most pages allocated to him gets the minimum number of pages, out of all possible permutations.

Note: Return -1 if a valid assignment is not possible, and allotment should be in contiguous order (see the explanation for better understanding).

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
A[] = {12,34,67,90}
M = 2
Output:113
Explanation:Allocation can be done in 
following ways:
{12} and {34, 67, 90} Maximum Pages = 191
{12, 34} and {67, 90} Maximum Pages = 157
{12, 34, 67} and {90} Maximum Pages =113.
Therefore, the minimum of these cases is 113,
which is selected as the output. **/

Solution : Approach is atleast each student should get one book that is the book with maximum n.of pages will be our 1st possibility of minimum pages.

    public static int isPossible(int[] a,int barrier){
        int pages=0,students=1;

                pages+=a[i];
            }
            else{
                students+=1;
                pages=a[i];
            }

       return students;
    }
    //Function to find minimum number of pages.
