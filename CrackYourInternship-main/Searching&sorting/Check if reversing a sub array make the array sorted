/** Given an array of n distinct integers. The task is to check whether reversing any one sub-array can make the array sorted or not. If the array is already sorted or can be made sorted by reversing any one subarray, print “Yes“, else print “No“.

Examples: 

Input : arr [] = {1, 2, 5, 4, 3}
Output : Yes
By reversing the subarray {5, 4, 3}, the array will be sorted.

Input : arr [] = { 1, 2, 4, 5, 3 }
Output : No **/

Solutions :: 
 1.compare woth sorted array and find starting and ending index and reverse the portion and again check.
 2.check arr[i+1]-arr[i]==1 and find where this condition breaks and from there arr[i+1]-arr[i]==-1 is true then true else false.
